            A comet from another star system, 3I/Atlas, made its closest approach to Earth this week, passing safely at a distance of 167 million miles (269 million kilometers). Discovered in July by NASA's Atlas telescope in Chile, the comet is estimated to be between 440 meters and 5.6 kilometers in size.

            NASA continues to monitor the icy visitor with its space telescopes, although the comet is fading as it exits the solar system, offering backyard astronomers a final chance to observe it. Scientists note that 3I/Atlas will pass much closer to Jupiter in March, within 33 million miles (53 million kilometers), before heading back to interstellar space, not to return for thousands of years.
